# Test iOS

Integrate the screens below as best as you can.

- Request the data from the route : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/popina/test-ios/master/data.json
- Parse the response
- Add a loader and error handling in case the network is slow or api is down.
- You can use AFNetworking, AlamoFire, SwiftyJSON ... or any other pod you might find useful and helpful.
- Structure with a MVC pattern

## Rules to follow
- Code in Swift
- Make a Swift Package that encapsulates all data management
- You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test
- if you can't finish this test, make sure you provide a minimal viable product and add comments about the next steps

## Deliverables

- the link to the git repository
- several commits, with an explicit message each time
- a separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
